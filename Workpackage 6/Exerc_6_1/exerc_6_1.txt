1.  It creates one thread.

2.  Line 16 declares the thread ID "tid". 
    line 17 creates the thread attribute data structure "attr".
    Line 20 initializes attr.
    Line 25 creates a new thread that calls the function "runner".
    Line 26 makes the program wait until the thread is done rather than exit immediately after creating it.

3.  No parameters are passed to runner. This is signified by the fourth argument "NULL" when calling pthread_create.

4.  These variables are declared outside of any function, meaning they are global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

5.  When omitting line 26, the program does not wait for the thread to finish, which results in it proceeding to attempt sorting the
    numbers before the runner function has been able to generate any.
